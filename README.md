Model importer for Monster Hunter (PS2) games.

Made for Blender 4.0.

Note: this importer is highly experimental and in dire need of a full rewrite.

# Features

* Model Import (_amh.bin files)
* Texture Import
    * Only works with MH1 and MHG, by supplying a _tex.bin texture file or path to a folder with numbered textures
