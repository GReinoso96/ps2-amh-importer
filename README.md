Model importer for Monster Hunter (PS2) games.

Made for Blender 4.0.

Note: this importer is highly experimental and in dire need of a full rewrite.

# Features

* Model Import (_amh.bin files)
* Texture Import
    * For MH1 and MHG, you can leave the texture path empty to attempt to autoload from a _tex.bin file.
    * For MH1, MHG and MH2, you can specify a folder with PNG textures instead.
